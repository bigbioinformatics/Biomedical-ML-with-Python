    "Hello, and welcome to this introductory course in Machine Learning for Biomedical applications. To kick things off, I'd like to introduce you to [Weka](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/) one of the first Machine Learning platforms I used when I started out learning ML. Please take a minute and checkout [this great Weka video tutorial](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/)by Google. I think Weka is a great gateway platform that will undoubtedly take you a long way down these first steps into the ML ecosystem. In fact, Weka is still my goto platform for exploratory data analysis (EDA) which is the topic of today. Follow along the Weka example in the accompanying Lecture slides as we get to know the autism dataset distributed along with this notebook."

Not only will your reviewers expect it, generating it is actually very useful to distill your understanding of the problem you propose to tackle. Fortunately there are many packages out there that will generate a table 1 for you. Here we will use the cleverly named 'tableone' package and stratify our summary based on the autism outcome."
