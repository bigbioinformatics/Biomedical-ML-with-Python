    "Today we will put everything we ahve learned so far to develop a complete end to end analysis. We will be working with gene expression data of leukemia patients aquired in 1999 and later [published in Science](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.286.5439.531). The paper demonstrated how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. The data was used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our excersice is to develop a model that discriminates between AML and ALL patients based only on the this gene expression data and compare our model with the published results of the 1999 paper."

An API token should automatically download and a prompt will also appear telling you which directory to put this token so python knows where find it.

The PCs explain fluctuations in the data itself not necessarily the biological relationships at play. It would be better to choose a representation that is more convienient for interpretation in a clinical setting. Let us aggregate the data of related genes into a value that represents the pathways they participate in. Finding the predictive pathways may be more useful to explain the biology, design future invivio models, and drive treatment development.\n",

For each pathway we will need to find all the genes in our dataset that participate in this pathway and describe how only these releated genes fluctuate.
